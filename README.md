Hi!
I'm going to outline the usage for this project

<
DOCKER
after running the docker image

going to http://localhost:3000 should display a page saying "Hi!"
if not then use your local ip address with the same port i.e. 192.168.10.100:3000

assuming that localhost is working for you you can begin to navigate through the project by going to
http://localhost:3000/home

OR you can see the project live at http://35.194.13.235

This page displays all of the available stores to buy from

clicking into a store will take you to /shop?shop=... ...
and this displays a stores wares (Products)

clicking on a product will navigate you to a page with the product details (price description etc.)
NOTE: you need to be logged in to "purchase any items"

<IF YOU HAVENT MADE AN ACCOUNT

click login from any page (this will navigate you to /login)
from here under the password input there is an option to register.

Once you have gotten to the register page you can create an account
usernames must be between 4 and 30 characters

submit the form to create your user
